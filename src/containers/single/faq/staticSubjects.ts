        answer:
          "Our team works with up to the minute data on the current market value of hundreds of smartphones on a daily basis. We use this data to provide you with the highest payout for your device with a quick payment. With the value of these devices changing almost daily, sometimes we are off on our estimates. If we lose money, then we take the loss. If your device goes for more than we anticipated, we will make sure to provide you, our customer, with a secondary payment based on final sales price. We want our customers to know that we are truly the best offer around."
