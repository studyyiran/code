        <p>If you’ve recently discovered the world of unlocked smartphone devices, you’re probably asking yourself some questions.</p>
        <p>What does it actually mean when a phone is "Unlocked?"  If you use a ATT, Verizon, Sprint or other carrier phone, can you get that phone unlocked?</p>
        <p>Is there any benefit in using an unlocked phone? What is the aftermarket resale value of an unlocked phone?</p>
        <p>So many questions, and all of them are valid. The world of unlocked phones is pretty mysterious, and only around 12% of smartphone users in the United States marketplace are using unlocked phones.</p>
        <p>Are you interested in finding out how to tell if a phone is unlocked? Let's take a look at some interesting facts.</p>
        <h2>What is an Unlocked Phone?</h2>
        <p>An unlocked phone is essentially a phone that is not attached to a particular carrier. When you purchase an unlocked phone, you can use a SIM card from a phone carrier and simply insert it into your unlocked device for data and wireless coverage.</p>
        <p>It’s very common for unlocked phones to feature “dual SIM” capabilities, meaning you can use more than one SIM card in your device at one time. This is ideal for people who travel internationally quite often.</p>
        <h2>The Benefits and Resale Value of Unlocked Phones</h2>
        <p>The main benefit is, of course, the lack of a contract. You won’t be tethered to one company. With an unlocked phone, you can freely choose whatever carrier you’d like as long as they offer standalone SIM cards for use with an unlocked phone. For this reason, the value of unlocked phones is typically higher versus a phone that is locked. This is reflected in our price calculation during our quotation process.</p>
        <h2>How to Tell if a Phone is Unlocked</h2>
        <p>There are several ways to tell if a phone is unlocked.</p>
        <p>First, is it a Verizon device? This carrier sells a majority of its smartphones unlocked.</p>
        <p>If it isn’t a device with a Verizon brand on it and you’ve purchased the phone elsewhere, such as Amazon or eBay, there is a good chance the device is authentic and unlocked. The listing for the device will have keywords like “unlocked” and “dual SIM.” The listing will also describe what type of SIM cards the device will take.</p>
        <p>If you want to physically check to see if your phone is unlocked, just pop open the back and look for an empty SIM slot. Some unlocked phones feature a pinhole device in which you use a tool to pop a tray out of the side of your device instead of cracking open the back. This tray will say “SIM” and “SD” on it if it is unlocked.</p>
        <h2>Can Carrier Phones Be Unlocked?</h2>
        <p>This depends on the brand of the device and the carrier it is attached to. Nowadays, only prepaid phones are usually the type to be sold with a SIM lock that prevents any attempt to unlock it. Many mobile carriers will allow the device to be unlocked and provide that service for you, but there are some ups and downs.</p>
        <p>Some carriers will absolutely refuse an unlock request or may make you wait an allotted amount of time before unlocking it. Some network carriers will not allow you to unlock your device if you are still paying it off as well.</p>
        <p>The best way to find out if your carrier supports device unlocking is to contact them. We definitely do not recommend attempting to unlock the device yourself, as this will (usually) void the warranty of the device.</p>
