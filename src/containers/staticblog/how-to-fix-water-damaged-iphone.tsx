        <p>You dropped your iPhone in water and now it won’t turn on. There’s no need to panic yet, but you do need to act quickly. </p>
        <p>Follow these steps in order to fix your water-damaged iPhone and hopefully get it working again. </p>
        <p>In the future, take extra precaution to protect your iPhone from water. If you follow all of the steps in this article and still can’t get your phone to turn on, it can still be of value.</p>
        <h2>The Steps to Get Your iPhone Working Again</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Don’t turn it on. When your iPhone is dropped in water, it often turns itself off. If it won’t turn on, don’t panic, and don’t keep trying to turn it on. </li>
          <li>Remove your SIM card. Use the SIM card removal tool or a paperclip and pop your SIM card out. Leave the tray open.</li>
          <li>Wipe the exterior of the phone. Use paper towel or a cloth to wipe all over the outside of the phone. If your iPhone has a case, take it off. Hold the phone still while you gently wipe water off the exterior.</li>
          <li>Absorb the water from your phone. There are a few methods to do this. Some choose to put their phone in a warm, dry place so the water evaporates; a sunny windowsill or on top of a TV or monitor are popular choices. Another option is to put silica gel packets around the phone. A common choice to fix a water-damaged iPhone is to submerge it in a container of uncooked rice and leave it for a day. The silica gel and rice methods will absorb the water from inside the phone.</li>
          <li>Use a hair dryer. If the above methods haven’t helped, consider using a hair dryer on low and holding it at a distance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Keep Your iPhone From Being Water-Damaged In The First Place</h2>
        <p>While newer iPhones are spill-resistant, even they aren’t entirely waterproof. There are some waterproof iPhone cases you could invest in if you often have to deal with potential water-damage. These can keep your iPhone safe if it gets dropped in water and will give you a little more peace of mind the next time you accidentally expose your iPhone to water.</p>
        <p>Take care when taking your iPhone into the washroom - many water-damage accidents are related to dropping a phone in the toilet. At the pool or the beach, it’s a good idea to keep your phone far from the water. </p>
        <h2>Some Water-Damaged Phones May Still Be Worth Something</h2>
        <p>If you’ve tried everything and your iPhone is too water-damaged to salvage, you might still be able to get some value out of it. On UpTradeit.com, you can get cash for broken phones, like a water-damaged iPhone. Even if your phone won’t work anymore, you can still sell it for some money. It might be a good idea to use that money to buy yourself a waterproof case for your next phone.</p>
